                PolicyCenter is a web-based underwriting and policy administration system designed for personal and commercial line carriers in the property and casualty insurance (P&C) industry. As the central point for all policy processes, PolicyCenter streamlines the process of submitting applications, renewing policies, and managing policy changes for both producers and underwriters. Auditing is available for certain types of policies. PolicyCenter delivers convenient access to agents, streamlines producer relationships, and improves under-writing risk assessment. It also provides intuitive user interfaces and simplified data structures. Using PolicyCenter, carriers are able to quickly respond to changing business requirements and grow the business in ways current legacy systems cannot. Typical users, such as underwriters and producers, can create and manage policies, service accounts, evaluate risks, view policies, create activities, and handle inquiries. PolicyCenter also provides access management tools for viewing groups and re-purposing workloads.
